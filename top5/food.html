                    Ever since I was young, I would always spend time with my mum in the kitchen. At first, this was usually because I was
                    hungry! But soon, I wanted to learn how to cook as good as she could.

                <p class="about-para">
                    Nowadays, I do a lot of cooking and like trying loads of different recipes. I mainly love Asian cuisine but also love
                    Western comfort foods. With my Top 5 Foods, I wanted to give you something delicious yet simple to make yourself!

                        Anyone who has ever had Japanese food, has probably had some sort of Katsu. For those who donâ€™t know, Katsu is deep
                        fried using Panko Breadcrumbs. These breadcrumbs are so crispy and so light. The original Katsu is Pork, but Chicken,
                        Tofu and Prawn are also delicious!
